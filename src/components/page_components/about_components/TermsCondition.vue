                  It is a general principle of scholarly communication that the
                  editor/guest editor of a learned journal/series is solely and
                  independently responsible for deciding which articles
                  submitted to the journal shall be published. In making this
                  decision the editor/guest editor is guided by policies of the
                  journal’s editorial board and constrained by such legal
                  requirements in force regarding libel, copyright infringement
                  and plagiarism. An outcome of this principle is the importance
                  of the scholarly archive as a permanent, historic record of
                  the transactions of scholarship. Articles that have been
                  published shall remain extant, exact and unaltered as far as
                  is possible. However, very occasionally circumstances may
                  arise where an article is published that must later be
                  retracted or even removed. Such actions must not be undertaken
                  lightly and can only occur under exceptional circumstances,
                  such as:

                  accidentally submitted twice. Occasionally, but less
                  frequently, the articles may represent infringements of
                  professional ethical codes, such as multiple submission, bogus
                  claims of authorship, plagiarism, fraudulent use of data or
                  the like.

                    This policy has been designed to address these concerns and
                    to take into account current best practice in the scholarly
                    and library communities. As standards evolve and change, we

                    The online article is preceded by a screen containing the

                    In an extremely limited number of cases, it may be necessary
                    to remove an article from the online database. This will
                    only occur where the article is clearly defamatory, or
                    infringes others’ legal rights, or where the article is, or
                    we have good reason to expect it will be, the subject of a
                    court order, or where the article, if acted upon, might pose
                    a serious health risk. In these circumstances, while the
                    metadata (Title and Authors) will be retained, the text will
                    be replaced with a screen indicating the article has been
                    removed for legal reasons.

                    In cases where the article, if acted upon, might pose a
                    serious health risk, the authors of the original article may
                    wish to retract the flawed original and replace it with a
                    corrected version. In these circumstances the procedures for
                    retraction will be followed with the difference that the
                    database retraction notice will publish a link to the
                    corrected re-published article and a history of the
                    document.
