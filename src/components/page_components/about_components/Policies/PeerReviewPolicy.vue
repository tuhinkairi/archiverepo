                  International Journal of Innovative Research in Engineering
                  (IJIRE) (Online), a Bi-monthly international journal for
                  publishing new ideas founded by academicians, educationists,
                  engineers, and corporate people. The research results and
                  fundamental advancement are all aspects of Innovative Research
                  in Advanced Engineering & Technology, various engineering
                  disciplines, etc. IJIRE is a scholarly open, accessible,
                  Double Blind Peer Review Journal that helps an academic person
                  and the student community. IJIRE provides the academic
                  community and industry for submitting original research and
                  applications related to Various Engineering disciplines and
                  Advanced Technologies.

                  The function of reviewers in the scholarly international
                  journal research publication is crucial. IJIRE employs a
                  double-blind peer review procedure, which means that
                  throughout the review process, both the names of the
                  reviewer(s) and author(s) are kept secret from one another. As
                  a result, neither the author(s) nor the reviewer(s) of the
                  document will be able to determine the name of the other (s).
                  Peer review enhances networking opportunities within
                  International Journal of Innovative Research groups and
                  assists in validating research by establishing a framework for
                  its evaluation. Despite critiques, peer review is still the
                  only commonly used strategy for study validation.

                  All submitted papers will be reviewed by a double-blind peer
                  review process which may take a minimum of 01 to 03 weeks from
                  the submission date. We advise all the author(s) not to submit
                  the same paper to multiple journals. It would help if you
                  waited for the review status of the paper.

                  (International Journal of Innovative Research Engineering)
                  were cross-checked for plagiarism software. Manuscripts found
                  to be plagiarized during the initial stages of review are

                  The Editor-in-Chief will launch a preliminary inquiry if a
                  work is discovered to have been plagiarized after it has been
                  published, perhaps with the aid of a pertinent group that has
                  been assembled. The publication will contact the author's
                  Institute/College/University and Funding Agency if any if the
                  paper is discovered to have excessive levels of plagiarism.
