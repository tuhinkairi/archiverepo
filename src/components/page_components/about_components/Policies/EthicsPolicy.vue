                <p>
                  The International Journal of Innovative Research in
                  Engineering is committed to ensuring ethics in the publication
                  and quality of articles. Especially International Journal of
                  Innovative Research in Engineering follows the Code of Conduct
                  defined by the Committee of Publication Ethics (COPE).

                </p>
                <p>
                  These ethics include the editor adhering to specific rules for
                  dealing with users, writers, and critics and protocols for
                  dealing with grievances. All parties engaged, including
                  authors, editors, reviewers, and the international journal
                  publisher, must adhere to ethical standards. More

                <h5>Authors:</h5>
                <p>
                  The authors should present an objective discussion of the
                  significance of the International Journal of Innovative
                  Research work and sufficient details and references.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Authors should maintain accurate records of data associated
                  with their submitted manuscript and supply or provide access
                  to these data on reasonable request. The authors guarantee
                  that all data used in the article is genuine and authentic.
                  Where appropriate and allowed by employers, funding bodies,
                  and others who might have an interest, authors should deposit
                  data in a suitable repository or storage location for sharing
                  and further use by others.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fraudulent or knowingly inaccurate statements constitute
                  unethical behavior and are unacceptable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The authors should make sure that their writing is completely
                  original and that, if any other people's ideas or phrases were
                  used, they have been properly recognized. All forms of
                  plagiarism are undesirable and comprise unethical writing
                  behavior. Publishing malpractice is when a single submission
                  is sent to several publications at once. Articles describing
                  basically the same study should only be submitted to one
                  journal.

                  Authors should acknowledge the financial support and
                  help/guidance of others if appropriate.

                  Each co-author should have made a substantial contribution to
                  the study. All co-authors should approve the final version of
                  the manuscript before being submitted for publishing, and the
                  corresponding author should ensure this.

                  Authors are required to take part in the peer evaluation

                  Authors should notify the editor promptly if a significant
                  error in their International journal research publication is
                  identified and cooperate with the editor to publish an
                  erratum, addendum, or corrigendum notice or to retract the
                  paper where it is deemed necessary.

                  Reports should be carried out honestly, and findings should be
