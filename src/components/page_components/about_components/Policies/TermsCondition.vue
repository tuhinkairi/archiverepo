                  It is a general principle of scholarly communication that the
                  editor/guest editor of a learned journal/series is solely and
                  independently responsible for deciding which articles
                  submitted to the international journal shall be published. In
                  making this decision, the editor/guest editor is guided by the
                  policies of the journal’s editorial board and constrained by
                  such legal requirements in force regarding libel, copyright
                  infringement, and plagiarism. An outcome of this principle is
                  the importance of the scholarly archive as a permanent,
                  historical record of the transactions of scholarship. Articles
                  that have been published shall remain extant, exact, and
                  unaltered as far as possible. However, occasionally,
                  circumstances may arise where an article is published that
                  must later be retracted or removed. Such actions must not be
                  undertaken lightly and can only occur under exceptional
                  circumstances, such as:

                  frequently, violate professional or ethical standards through

                    This policy has been designed to address these concerns and
                    consider current best practices in the scholarly and library
                    communities. As standards evolve and change, we will revisit
                    this issue and welcome the input of scholarly and library
                    communities. These issues require international standards,
                    and we will actively lobby various information bodies to
                    establish international standards and best practices that
                    the publishing and information industries can adopt.

                    Only used for Articles in Press that represent early versions of articles and sometimes contain errors or may have been accidentally submitted twice. Occasionally, but less frequently, the articles may represent infringements of professional, ethical codes, such as multiple submissions, bogus claims of authorship, plagiarism, fraudulent use of data, or the like. Articles in Press (articles that have been accepted for publication but which have not been formally published and will not yet have the complete volume/issue/page information) that include errors or are discovered to be accidental duplicates of other published article(s) or are determined to violate our journal publishing ethics guidelines in the view of the editors (such as multiple submission, bogus claims of authorship, plagiarism, fraudulent use of data or the like), maybe “Withdrawn” from IJIRE (International Journal of Innovative Research Engineering). Withdrawn means that the article content (HTML and PDF) is removed and replaced with an HTML page and PDF stating that the article has been withdrawn according to the IJIRE (International Journal of Innovative Research Engineering) Policy on Article in Press Withdrawal with a link to the current policy document.

                    Infringement of professional, ethical standards, such as numerous entries, false authorship claims, plagiarism, fraudulent data use, or similar offences. On rare occasions, a retraction will be used to fix submittal or publish mistakes. It has long been a rare occurrence in the academic world for a paper to be retracted by its authors or the editor on the advice of other scholars. Several scholarly and library organizations have created standards for handling retractions, and IJIRE (International Journal of Innovative Research Engineering) has embraced this best practice for paper retractions.

                    A retraction notice titled "Retraction: [article title],"
                    signed by the authors and the editor, is released in the
                    paginated section of the next journal issue and mentioned in
                    the contents list.

                  <p>
                    The online article is preceded by a screen containing the
                    retraction note. It is to this screen that the link
                    resolves; the reader can then proceed to the article itself.

                  <p>
                    The original article is kept in its entirety, with the
                    exception of a watermark on each page showing that it has
                    been "retracted." The HTML form of the text is no longer

                  <p>
                    In a minimal number of cases, removing an article from the
                    online database may be necessary. This will only occur where
                    the article is defamatory or infringes others’ legal rights,
                    or where the article is, or we have good reason to expect it
                    will be, the subject of a court order, or where the article,
                    if acted upon, might pose a severe health risk. While the
                    metadata (Title and Authors) will be retained, the text will
                    be replaced with a screen indicating the article has been
                    removed for legal reasons.

                  <p>
                    In cases where the article, if acted upon, might pose a
                    severe health risk, the original article's authors may wish
                    to retract the flawed original and replace it with a
                    corrected version. In these circumstances, the procedures
                    for retraction will be followed with the difference that the
                    database retraction notice will publish a link to the
                    corrected re-published article and a history of the
                    document.
