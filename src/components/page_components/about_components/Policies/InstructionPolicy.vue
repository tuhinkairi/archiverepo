                  International Journal of Innovative Research in Engineering
                  (IJIRE) is (Online), Bi-monthly international journal for
                  publishing new ideas founded by academicians, educationists,
                  engineers, and corporate people. The research results and
                  fundamental advancement are all aspects of Innovative Research
                  in Advanced Engineering & Technology, various engineering
                  disciplines, etc. IJIRE is a scholarly open, accessible,
                  Double Blind Peer Review Journal that helps an academic person
                  and student community. IJIRE (International Journal of
                  Innovative Research Engineering) provides the academic
                  community and industry for submitting original research and
                  applications related to Various Engineering disciplines and
                  Advanced Technologies.

                  Check that each figure/table is labeled and captioned—
                  Captions should be supplied individually, not affixed to the
                  figure. A caption should include a short title and a summary
                  of the image. Figures and tables should be marked individually
                  but sequentially after they appear in the text.

                  Every author is accountable for making sure that papers are
                  written with ethical standards regarding plagiarism before
                  they are published to the International Journal of Innovative
                  Research publication. Kindly be aware that all entries undergo
                  a comprehensive plagiarism check. Suppose an effort at
                  plagiarism is discovered in a paper that has already been
                  published. In that case, the writers will be required to send
                  a written apology to the creators of the original work. Any
                  paper with blatant plagiarism will be immediately refused, and
                  the writers may face a two-year publication ban from journals
                  if their work is found to be plagiarized. If such a
                  circumstance occurs, the writers will be appropriately
                  notified.
