                  It is a scholarly communication general concept that the
                  editor/guest editor of a learned journal/series is exclusively
                  and independently accountable for deciding which papers
                  submitted to the journal will be published. In making this
                  choice, the editor/guest editor is led by the editorial
                  board's policies and limited by current legal requirements
                  regarding libel, copyright violation, and plagiarism. As a
                  result of this concept, the academic archive is essential as a
                  permanent, historical document of scholarly interactions.
                  Articles already released must be kept as accurate and
                  unaltered as feasible. However, there are times when a piece
                  must be retracted or deleted after it has been released. Such
                  acts should not be done lightly and should only be carried out
                  in exceptional situations, such as:

                  contain errors or may have been accidentally submitted twice.
                  Occasionally, but less frequently, the articles may represent
                  infringements of professional, ethical codes, such as multiple
                  submissions, bogus claims of authorship, plagiarism,
                  fraudulent use of data, or the like.

                  <b>Article withdrawal Policy:</b>International Journal of

                  Bi-monthly international journal for publishing new ideas
                  founded by academicians, educationists, engineers, and
                  corporate people. The research results and fundamental
                  advancement are all aspects of Innovative Research in
                  Engineering & Technology, various engineering disciplines,
                  etc. IJIRE is scholarly open, access, Double Blind Peer Review
                  Journal which helps academic persons and the student
                  community. IJIRE (International Journal of Innovative Research
                  Engineering) provides the academic community and industry for
                  submitting original research and applications related to
                  Various Engineering disciplines and Advanced Technologies.
                  IJIRE (International Journal of Innovative Research
                  Engineering) recognizes the importance of the integrity and
                  completeness of the scholarly record to researchers and
                  librarians and attaches the highest importance to maintaining
                  trust in the authority of its electronic archive.

                  <b>IJIRE Policy:</b>It is a general principle of scholarly
                  communication that the editor/guest editor of a learned
                  journal/series is solely and independently responsible for
                  deciding which articles submitted to the international journal
                  shall be published. In making this decision, the editor/guest
                  editor is guided by the policies of the journal’s editorial
                  board and constrained by such legal requirements in force
                  regarding libel, copyright infringement, and plagiarism. An
                  outcome of this principle is the importance of the scholarly
                  archive as a permanent, historical record of the transactions
                  of scholarship. Articles that have been published shall remain
                  extant, exact, and unaltered as far as possible. However,
                  occasionally, circumstances may arise where an article is
                  published that must later be retracted or removed. Such
                  actions must not be undertaken lightly and can only occur
                  under exceptional circumstances.

                  claims, plagiarism, fraudulent data use, or similar offences.
                  On rare occasions, a retraction will be used to fix submittal
                  or publish mistakes. It has long been a rare occurrence in the
                  academic world for a paper to be retracted by its authors or
                  the editor on the advice of other scholars. Several scholarly
                  and library organizations have created standards for handling
                  retractions, and IJIRE (International Journal of Innovative
                  Research Engineering) has embraced this best practice for
                  paper retractions.

                  A retraction notice titled "Retraction: [article title],"
                  signed by the authors and the editor, is released in the
                  paginated section of the next journal issue and mentioned in

                  The online article is preceded by a screen containing the

                  The original international journal paper is kept in its

                  <b>Article removal: legal limitations: </b>In a minimal number
                  of cases, removing an article from the online database may be
                  necessary. This will only occur where the article is
                  defamatory or infringes others’ legal rights, or where the
                  article is, or we have good reason to expect it will be, the
                  subject of a court order, or where the article, if acted upon,
                  might pose a severe health risk. While the metadata (Title and
                  Authors) will be retained, the text will be replaced with a
                  screen indicating the article has been removed for legal
                  reasons.

                  <b>Article replacement: </b>In cases where the article, if
                  acted upon, might pose a severe health risk, the original
                  article's authors may wish to retract the flawed original and
                  replace it with a corrected version. In these circumstances,
                  the procedures for retraction will be followed with the

                  evolve and change, and we encourage feedback from the

                  international standards, and we intend to actively urge
