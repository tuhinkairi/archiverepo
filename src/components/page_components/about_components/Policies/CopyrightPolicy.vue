                  In order for journal to publish and disseminate research
                  articles, we need publishing rights. This is determined by a
                  publishing agreement between the author and Journal. This
                  agreement deals with the transfer or license of the copyright
                  to journal and authors retain significant rights to use and
                  share their own published articles. IJIRE journal support the
                  need for authors to share, disseminate and maximize the impact
                  of their research and these rights, in Am Publications
