                Every scientist aspires to get published in a scientific
                journal. The pressure of ‘publish or perish’ is something every
                researcher faces, and getting published in a high-quality
                journal helps move on to the next rung (or even skip a few
                rungs) up the ladder. The journey from finishing a scientific
                study and getting it into the public eye can be long and
                strenuous. According to an Elsevier report, 1.8 million authors
                submitted 1.3 million manuscripts in 2015, however, only 400,000
                (approximately 22%) of them were published. Nature publishes
                only 8% of the 200 papers it receives each week. So while you
                may be making significant progress in your research in the
                confines of your lab, telling the world about it involves quite
                a few barriers — and also requires years of patience.
