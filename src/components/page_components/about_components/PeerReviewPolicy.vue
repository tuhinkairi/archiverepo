                  Reviewers play a central role in scholarly publishing. IJIRE
                  uses double-blind peer review process, which means that both
                  the reviewer(s) and author(s) identities are concealed from
                  the reviewer(s), and vice versa, throughout the review
                  process. This means that the reviewer(s) of the paper won’t
                  get to know the identity of the author(s), and the author(s)
                  won’t get to know the identity of the reviewer(s). Peer review
                  helps validate research, establish a method by which it can be
                  evaluated, and increase networking possibilities within
                  research communities. Despite criticisms, peer review is still
                  the only widely accepted method for research validation.

                  All submitted papers will be reviewed by double blind peer
                  review process which may take minimum 01 to 03 weeks from the
                  date of submission. We are advising to all the author(s), do
                  not submit same paper to the multiple journals. You should
                  wait for review status of paper.
